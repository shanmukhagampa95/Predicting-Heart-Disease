# [A] HeartDisease_Prediction-
To anticipate how likely, it is that people will Effect  HeartDisease or not. We'll also compare the accuracy of different models and choose the best one.

## [B]Problem Statement:

It aims to model and predict the presence of heart disease in patients by using binary classification machine learning algorithms.
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,Adaboost,xgboost,Logistic Regression This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn'

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

## [C]Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression 
2. Adaboost
3. K-Nearest Neighbours 
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest 
6. XGBoost 

## [d] Dataset:
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

UCI Heart Disease Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease?spm=5176.100239.blogcont54260.8.TRNGoO)

## [E] Program:

We have to setup some methods/steps that we will be following to get our desired results:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis

2.About the models

3.Comparing the model results

4.Selection of the best model

## [F] Exploratory Data Analysis:
In this step we will be loading and cleaning the data. Cleaning which will involve missing value treatment, dropping the unwanted variables, changing categorical variables to machine understandable format, dummy variable creation, graphical interpretation and splitting the data set into train and test.
